## What would be a good talk topic?

We accept a variety of technical and non-technical talks and the audience has varying technical backgrounds and interests.

Talks from accepted proposals have focused on, but not limited to:

- Sharing the process and journey of how you created something and what you've learned.

- A dive into a particular technical concept.

Examples of topics that may not get accepted:
